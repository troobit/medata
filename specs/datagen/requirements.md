Need to generate test data for UI.
Test data should be at least 1 month of 5-minute Blood sugar level data, 2 shots of basal per day (7am, 7pm, 15 units each time), and 3 bolus shots for meals, and some for liquor and snacks.
The data should be up to date and generated with a script for local dev. It should be dated such that the most recent entry is a few minutes ago.
Data shouldn't be the same each time - it can be somewhat stochastic around a semi-normal range for diabetes t1 patients
It will be using mmo/l as the measurement unit.
Exercise will be swims (default for 1hr, high intensity), cycle, 20 mins, medium, and walk 40 mins low.
